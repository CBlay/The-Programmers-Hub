*PHP programming tutorials - Designed by Cassidy Blay for theprogrammershub.net
*Getting started with your first PHP file.
**/


PHP files are saved with the extention .php 
**
Launch your code editor and click on save as, or Ctrl+S and then save your file as "index.php" (without the quotes)
And there you go! You have your first PHP file.

***htdocs
htdocs is the folder in which you keep all you PHP files. To locate the htdocs folder, visit the location of the XAMPP installation and open. Browse through
the files and folders until you see a folder named "htdocs".(The folder will probably be located in yourDrive(C://)>>XAMPP>>htdocs ). Create a
new folder in your htdocs and save it as "hub". Now move or copy and paste the index.php file that we created earlier into the hub folder in htdocs.
This is where we are going to save all the files for our tutorial.
**
Now let's test to see if everything is working. Launch your web browser and type "localhost/hub". If the page loads(the page should be blank since we 
haven't written anything in our file) you did the right thing. If you receive an error, start the process again.

***NB: I skipped things such as the phpinfo function and the php.ini configuration file. We will mention them along the course of the tutorial.
